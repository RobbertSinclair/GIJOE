# Glasgow Interactive JavaScript Online Editor

## What is GIJOE?

The Glasgow Interactive JavaScript Online Editor is a web-based JavaScript coding environment
for novices. It enables users to write short snippets of JavaScript code in a textbox,
then execute this by clicking a 'run' button and observing the results immediately.

We expect code to output string values to the console log (which we visualize) and
to generate simple graphics with turtle libraries (which we support directly). These 
small programs are typical 'beginner' exercises, which we will embed in our
Computational Thinking with JavaScript MOOC.

## Running Instructions

### Docker Installation

To generate the docker image, simply execute
`docker build -t gijoe .`
from within this directory. Then run this container with
`docker run -p 8080:8080 -d gijoe`

and browse to http://localhost:8080 to see GIJOE in action.

### Direction Execution

To run directly using node, simply execute
`npm install`
from within this directory to fetch the appropriate packages. Then
run the app with
`node lightserver.js`

and browse to http://localhost:8080 to see GIJOE in action.


## Sightings in the Wild

We are intending to run GIJOE in the online labs for our
upcoming Coursera specialization entitled *Computational
Thinking with JavaScript*.
